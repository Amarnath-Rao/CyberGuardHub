### SecureNet Marketplace

#### How We Built It
The development journey began with a clear purposeâ€”creating a user-friendly platform. We implemented smart contracts using the ERC721 standard, integrating privacy features for confidential transactions. The UI/Contract frontend was carefully designed to ensure a seamless and engaging interaction for users.

#### Challenges We Ran Into
Axios network errors during image loading and transitioning from ERC20 to ERC721 presented initial challenges. Testing and debugging the smart contract added complexity, and time constraints were a constant factor. However, these challenges fueled our determination to deliver a robust solution.

#### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Successfully overcoming the hurdles and delivering a functional MVP within the hackathon timeframe is a significant achievement. The integration of privacy features, the implementation of a bidding system, and the overall user experience are accomplishments we take pride in.

#### What We Learned
The development process provided valuable insights into smart contracts, ERC721 standards, and the nuances of Blockchain. Learning to navigate challenges, from image loading issues to adapting to a new token standard, enhanced our skills in blockchain development.

### Secure Sphere

### Scanner Tools

CyberGuard Hub incorporates a variety of scanner tools aimed at detecting and mitigating different types of cybersecurity threats. These tools are seamlessly integrated into the platform, providing users with comprehensive security capabilities to safeguard their systems and data. Below is an overview of the scanner tools available in CyberGuard Hub:

## SQL Injection Scanner

The SQL Injection Scanner is designed to detect and mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. By analyzing input fields and SQL queries, the scanner identifies potential injection points and tests for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to databases or execute malicious SQL commands.

### Usage:

To use the SQL Injection Scanner:

1. Navigate to the "SQL Injection Scanner" section in CyberGuard Hub.
2. Enter the URL of the web application you want to scan.
3. Configure the scanner settings and start the scan.
4. Review the scan results to identify and address any detected vulnerabilities.

## Virus Scanner

The Virus Scanner is a powerful tool for detecting and removing malware from systems and files. Using advanced scanning algorithms, the scanner examines files for known malware signatures, suspicious behaviors, and other indicators of compromise. It helps users identify and eliminate malicious software that could compromise the security and integrity of their systems.

### Usage:

To use the Virus Scanner:

1. Upload the file or specify the directory you want to scan.
2. Start the scan to analyze the selected files for malware.
3. Review the scan report to identify any detected threats and take appropriate action to remove or quarantine them.

## CVE ID Information

The CVE ID Information tool provides users with access to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, which catalogs and describes known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Users can search for specific CVE IDs to retrieve detailed information about vulnerabilities, including their severity, affected software, and available patches or mitigations.

### Usage:

To search for CVE ID information:

1. Enter the CVE ID you want to look up in the search bar.
2. Click "Search" to retrieve the CVE details.
3. Review the information provided to understand the nature of the vulnerability and any recommended actions for mitigation.

## XSS Scanner

The XSS Scanner is designed to detect and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. By analyzing input fields and client-side scripts, the scanner identifies potential XSS attack vectors and tests for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.

### Usage:

To use the XSS Scanner:

1. Navigate to the "XSS Scanner" section in CyberGuard Hub.
2. Enter the URL of the web application you want to scan.
3. Configure the scanner settings and start the scan.
4. Review the scan results to identify and address any detected vulnerabilities.

## CSRF Scanner

The CSRF Scanner helps users identify and mitigate cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in web applications. By analyzing HTTP requests and session tokens, the scanner detects potential CSRF attack vectors and tests for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.

### Usage:

To use the CSRF Scanner:

1. Navigate to the "CSRF Scanner" section in CyberGuard Hub.
2. Enter the URL of the web application you want to scan.
3. Configure the scanner settings and start the scan.
4. Review the scan results to identify and address any detected vulnerabilities.
